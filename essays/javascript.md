# A Faster Way to Code
As a student enrolled in ICS 314, one requirement was to learn JavaScript. While doing the [Introduction to JavaScript Basics](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript) tutorial, I noticed that there were a lot of similarities to other coding languages. There were some features such as arrays and classes that are used in C++, that were easy to pick up on. However, there were also some differences, especially syntax wise. One thing that I noticed about JavaScript is how I no longer have to worry about types. I find it interesting that JavaScript is versatile enough to know when something is an integer and not mistake it for something else. Another thing JavaScript can do is compare an integer with a string. It is amazing to see how much syntax can differ regardless if they do the same thing. Had I known about JavaScript sooner I would have seen how efficient it can be. Learning more about JavaScript has opened my eyes into a whole new language. 

# Programming Work Outs
Another requirement for our class is to participate in athletic software engineering. We do Work Outs of the Day aka WODs to help us improve our software skills. Here we are given a problem and we have to solve it using JavaScript within a time limit. This doesn't sound too appealing to me as I break under pressure. Knowing I am being timed makes me nervous and I all I can do is panic. I start to over complicated things and make simple errors. I understand the reason for WODs. As much as I dislike the idea of a WOD, it can only help me get better. After experiencing a couple of them I can see why we do them. In the industry I am going to be tested. I need to learn now how to get the problem done and show that I am capable. I hope that by the end of the semester I will know how to put my panic aside and get the problem done.

# Last Remarks
Overall, I can not wait to learn more about JavaScript. Knowing that JavaScript has even more features to offer is something to look forward to. WODs are okay, I guess. Even though I personally do not like them I just need to remind myself that I am going to get better from doing them. This is only the beginning of school and I have already learned so much. I look forward to seeing what else this course has to offer.
