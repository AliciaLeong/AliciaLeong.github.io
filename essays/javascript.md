# My Thoughts on JavaScript
As a student enrolled in ICS 314, one requirement was to learn JavaScript. While doing the [Introduction to JavaScript Basics](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript) tutorial, I noticed that there were a lot of similarities to other coding languages. There were some features such as arrays and classes that are used in C++, that were easy to pick up on. However, there were also some differences, especially syntax wise. After completing the basics I am really excited to learn more! One of my favorite things about JavaScript is how I no longer have to worry about types. I am amazed that JavaScript is versatile enough to know when something is an integer and not something like a string. Another thing I really enjoy is that it can even compare an integer with a string. Had I know about JavaScript sooner I would have see how over complicated other syntax can be. Don't get me wrong, I do sill enjoy coding in other languages. But, learning more about JavaScript opened my eyes into a whole new language that could be great to experiment with. 

# Work Outs of the Day?
Another requirement for our class is to participate in Work Outs of the Day aka WODs. Here we are given a problem and we have to solve it using JavaScript with a time limit. This doesn't sound too appealing to me. Why? Because I break under pressure. Knowing I am being timed makes me nervous and I break into a panic, start to over complicated things, and just make simple errors. So, I understand the reason for them. As much as I dislike the idea of a WOD, it can only help me get better. I hope that by the end of the semester I will know how to put my panic aside and get the problem done.

# Last Remarks
Overall, I can not wait to learning more about JavaScript. Knowing that I have only learned the basics gets me excited to know that JavaScript has even more features. WODs are okay, I guess. Even though I personally do not like them I just need to remind myself that I am going to get better from doing them. This is only the beginning of school and I have already learned so much. I look forward to seeing what else this course has to offer.
