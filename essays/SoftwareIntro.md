## Introduction
When I enrolled at the University I was lost as to what I wanted to do with my future. I spent a year hoping that I would be able to find something that interested me. That is when I came across computer engineering. From a young age I always wondered how a computer worked. Now that I am in my last year of college I have learned a lot about the different components of computers. Software has had a great impact on me. Learning to program taught me a lot. And important lesson I learned is that taking breaks are okay. 

## There is Still More
Even though I have been taking software courses for a while, there is still much more to learn. I hope that in this last year I learn to think of a solution in a moments notice. ICS 314 has work outs of the day (WODs) that will help me reach this goal as it will teach me to not panic and thing the problem through. I also hope to become more comfortable using JavaScript and different frameworks. It is always a plus to expand your knowledge of different tools. 

## The Ending of a Chapter
I know that even after I graduate there will still be a lot left to be learned. My hope is that what I am learning now will give me the right tools I need to build my future.
