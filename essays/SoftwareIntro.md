## Introduction
I was always asked "so what do you plan to major in at college?" but, I could never answer that question. I didn't know what I wanted to study. I always felt pressured by this decision as this choice would change my life forever. When I enrolled at the University I spent some time taking general classes to see if anything appealed to me. That's when I decided on Computer Engineering. From a young age I always wondered how a computer worked and this was my chance to finally learn the answer to my question.

## Step By Step
I was excited when I took my first programming course. It made me feel cool because I could make my computer print "Hello World!". I was fascinated by programming as it was challenging but, when ever I got something to work it felt like a small victory! Programming is not easy, but I enjoy doing it because of the fulfilling feeling I get when I finally overcome a problem. 

Even though I have been taking software courses for a while, there is still so much more to learn. I hope that in this last year I learn to look at my problems in a different way. ICS 314 has work outs of the day (WODs) that will help me reach this goal. I hope to master another language, JavaScript, and use it to create something fulfilling. Overall, my goal is to become a good engineer. I want to help create projects that will be useful and allow others to learn.

## The Ending of a Chapter
Now that I am in my last year of college I have learned a lot about the software side of engineering. Learning to code has taught me a lot of problem solving skills. I know that even after I graduate there will still be a lot left to be learned. My hope is that what I am learning now will give me the right tools I need to continue building my future.
