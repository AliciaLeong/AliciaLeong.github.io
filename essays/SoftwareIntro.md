# Introduction
When I enrolled at the University I was lost as to what I wanted to do with my future. I spent a year hoping that I would be able to find something that interested me. That is when I came across computer engineering. From a young age I always wondered how a computer worked. After declaring my major I have been in a journey to build my future. Now that I am in my last year of college I have learned a lot about the different components of computers. Software side of engineering has had a great impact on me. Learning to program taught me a lot of problem solving skills. 

# There is Still More
Even though I have been taking software courses for a while, there is still much more to learn. I hope that in this last year I learn to think of a solution in a moments notice. ICS 314 has work outs of the day (WODs) that will help me reach this goal. I hope I learn not to panic and to think the problem through. I also hope to become more comfortable using JavaScript and different frameworks. Overall, my goal is to become a good engineer. I want to help create projects that will be useful and allow users learn.

# The Ending of a Chapter
I know that even after I graduate there will still be a lot left to be learned. My hope is that what I am learning now will give me the right tools I need to build my future.
