## Classroom Notes
## Overview
### The Problem
Taking notes in a class can be a challenge as there are times when the professor may something that you did not get to write down. Or what if you missed a class as you were sick. Notes are a an important part of class but they can not always be perfect.
### The Solution
Create a online forum where students can create a class forum to upload and share notes. Students will have the ability to share and comment on each others notes allowing everyone to succeed in class. Students will be able to create a page specifically  for that class. Once it is created other students can subscribe and start contributing to the notes.

## Mockup Page Ideas

### Settings
