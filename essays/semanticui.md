## How is Semantic UI
(A Whole New World plays in the background) When we were first learning about HTML and CSS, I struggled a lot with CSS. There was just so may different properties that I needed learn. Some were straight forward like background-color, but others such as knowing the difference between padding and margins gave me a hard time. I just could not visualize what it would look like until I actually checked my web page. Sometimes I was completely off and used trial and error to make things look a certain way. And while yes, Semantic UI does have a learning curve, it's not impossible to learn. I personally also struggled in the beginning. But with more practice I was able to find patterns that I would use to help me know which tool to use. 

# The Learning Curve
Learning to use a framework is very similar to learning a new programming language. There are different properties and methods that you have to learn. However, it is not an impossible thing to do. We all have proof as we all learned JavaScript. I personally believe it is worth the struggling to help learn something that can make things easier in the long run. Knowing when it is an appropriate time to use it is the challenge. For example the underscore library, sometimes it is very useful but in other cases it may not. Semantic UI is similar to this. There are so many different classes that can make styling so much easier. But there are times when Semantic UI could make it more difficult. Learning when to use a framework is the main challenge.
