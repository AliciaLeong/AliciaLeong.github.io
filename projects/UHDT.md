#University of Hawaii Drone Technologies
UHDT is a project that strives to design a fully autonomous drone that can use object recognition to deliver supplies. During an emergency the drone would be deployed to deliver resources. My role in the electronic subsystem was to conduct research on GPS to see if we could geo-tag targets in real time. To do this we needed to see if we could access our telemetry logs. However, we ended up using a script to send the GPS location.
