## Smart Campus Energy Lab
I work on a firmware team to help improve and develop firmware for a network of sensors. Theses sensors are able to collect data from the environment. The overall goal is to convert the University of Hawaii campus to run on 100 percent renewable energy. Our role is to deploy these sensor networks around the campus to help determine where solar panels and other renewable energy sources can be located.
