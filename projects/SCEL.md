# What is Smart Campus Energy Lab?
The goal of Smart Campus Energy Lab is to help the University of Hawaii run on 100% renewable energy. Currently we are  aiming to deploy sensor networks (weather-boxes) around the campus to help determine where solar panels and other renewable energy sources can be located. Some of these sensors include temperature, pressure, solar irradiance and humidity.

# What Do I Do?
<img class="ui centered image" src="../images/sceldiagram.png">
I am on a team that works on the firmware. Our main goal is to assist teams that are building sensor networks by implementing firmware that can collect the meteorological data. We then create a packet, which contains our sensor data, that will be transmitted to our database. In addition to our sensor packet, we also have a second packet that contains the status of the sensor network itself. Above is a block diagram to help visualize the structure of the firmware. Some applications that we utilize is [Atom](https://atom.io/) as our text editor. Another application is [Platformio](https://platformio.org/) to build and upload our firmware. We also use a combination of C and C++ to write our code. 

This project has help me learn more about what it takes work a large scale project. Teamwork is important as there are many components that have be put together to create our sensor network.
